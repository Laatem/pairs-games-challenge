## Principle

For each turn, the user must provide coordinates (example A1 or C7) to reveal a map, then another to find the right pairs, if the cards are identical they will stay visible, otherwise they will turn back and game continue

## Step

- Create a gid with column and row for the coordinates
- Create a data structure for the game
- Manage all keyboard entries for the game process
- Develop the logic of the game
- Create a [.yml](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-yaml) configuration file
- Implement a function to save and load a game

**Bonus** : Create a difficulty mode (easy / hard) to handle a higher number of moves per level

## Conditions
- The display must done using command line
- Handle the clearing of the command line after each use
- Handle exceptions of users entries
- Identify the grid with numbers for rows and letters for columns (from 1 to 10 and from A to J)
- The database must be handle using [tinydb](https://tinydb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started.html)
- Use the [Memento](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/memento/python/example) design pattern to handle load / save
- A new game start to level 0 (2x2 grid) to level 4
```
level 0 : 2 x 2
level 1 : 4 x 4
level 2 : 6 x 6
level 3 : 8 x 8
level 4 : 10 x 10
```

## Configuration file

- `grid_level`: size of the grid by level
- `front` : symbol for the visible side of card
- `back` : symbol for the back of card
```
level: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

## Run the project

### Configuration
You can check and change the configuration in the `conf.yml` file located in the root of the project
```bash
pairs-games-challenge/conf.yml
```

### Standalone
At your own risk of compatibility, from the project root folder
```bash
python3 app/pairs.py
```
or
```bash
python app/pairs.py
```

### Docker

#### Build the image
Inside the project root folder
```bash
docker build --pull --rm -f "Dockerfile" -t pairsgameschallenge:latest "." 
```

#### Run the container
In any command-line interpreter
```bash
docker run pairsgameschallenge
```

**Play the game !**
